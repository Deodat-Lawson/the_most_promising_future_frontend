                        <p>
                            My journey in educational consulting began when I witnessed talented students
                            struggling to navigate the complex university admission process. With over 15 years
                            of experience in higher education, I've dedicated my career to helping students
                            unlock their full potential and access the best educational opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having served as both a university admissions officer and college counselor,
                            I understand the admissions process from both sides. This unique perspective
                            allows me to provide invaluable insights to my students, helping them present
                            their strongest applications and find their perfect university match.

                            I believe every student has unique potential that deserves to be recognized
                            and nurtured. My approach combines personalized attention with data-driven

                            I work closely with each student to understand their aspirations, strengths,
                            and challenges, creating tailored strategies that lead to successful outcomes.
